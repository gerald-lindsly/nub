	Sibling nodes merged during key deletion in some additional cases.

2009/02/06:  0.3.1
    During key deletion, sibling nodes are now combined in the majority of cases
		where this is possible.
	Improvement to ResourceFile::remove(): Now merging free areas in resource
	    files for more dynamic response.
	    
2009/02/02: 0.3.0
	IndexT is now a configurable template with options for the key interface,
		index and data file offset sizes, node size and node cache size.
	Unicode keys now supported.

2009/01/30: 0.2.0
	Improvements:
	    64-bit file positions now supported for huge indexes and resource files.
			Note that this entails new file structures.  Old files will need to
			be rebuilt.
		Node cache is now per index instead of globally shared.  Moving towards
		    making the code thread-safe.
		IndexKey IndexNode::key0 defined instead char IndexNode::keys[] for
			syntactic cleanup.
		Minor speed improvements in Index::insert() (key to insert is not copied so much)
		Changed a cpl keystrokes in test_ndx and added a command line spec for the
			index filename.
	Bug fixes: Cache memory for freed nodes was not being reused.
